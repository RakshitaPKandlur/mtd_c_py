FARMER PROBLEM STATEMENT
 
Mahesh is a farmer and owns 80 acres of land. His land is equally divided into 5 segments. He grows 
tomatoes in the 1st segment, potatoes in the 2nd segment, cabbage in the 3rd segment, sunflower in 
the 4th segment and sugarcane in the 5th segment. 
He is converting his land from chemical-driven farming to chemical-free farming. Mahesh starts with 
the conversion of vegetables into chemical-free produce. He spends the first 6 months doing the same.  
He then converts the sunflower land bank into chemical-free farming. This takes him another 4 
months. Finally, he converts sugarcane into chemical-free farming over the next 4 months. 
He gets a yield of the following for tomatoes. 30% of his tomato land gives him 10 tonne yield per acre. 
The remaining 70% of his tomato land gives him 12 tonnes yield per acre. The selling price of tomato 
is Rs. 7 per Kg. 
The yield of potatoes is 10 tonnes per acre. He sells each kg at Rs. 20. 
The yield of cabbage is 14 tonnes per acre. He sells each kg at Rs. 24. 
The yield of sunflowers is 0.7 tonnes per acre. He sells each kg at Rs. 200. 
The yield of sugarcane is 45 tonnes per acre. He sells each tonne at Rs. 4,000. 
All the crops are sowed at the same time. Mahesh gets the above yield at the above-mentioned rate 
in one crop cycle across his entire land of 80 acres. 
What is  
a. The overall sales achieved by Mahesh from the 80 acres of land. 
b. Sales realisation from chemical-free farming at the end of 11 months?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part a: The Overall Sales Achieved by Mahesh from the 80 Acres of Land
Step 1: Calculate the Yield for Each Crop

We know that Mahesh's land is divided into 5 equal segments of 16 acres each (since 80 acres ÷ 5 segments = 16 acres per segment). The crops grown are tomatoes, potatoes, cabbage, sunflower, and sugarcane.

Tomatoes:
Tomato Yield Breakdown:

30% of the land gives a yield of 10 tonnes per acre.
70% of the land gives a yield of 12 tonnes per acre.
Total Tomato Land: 16 acres

30% of 16 acres = 4.8 acres, which gives 10 tonnes per acre.

70% of 16 acres = 11.2 acres, which gives 12 tonnes per acre.

Now, let's calculate the total yield for tomatoes:

Tomato Yield (30% of land): 4.8 acres × 10 tonnes = 48 tonnes

Tomato Yield (70% of land): 11.2 acres × 12 tonnes = 134.4 tonnes

Total Tomato Yield = 48 tonnes + 134.4 tonnes = 182.4 tonnes

Selling Price of Tomato = Rs. 7 per kg

1 tonne = 1000 kg, so 182.4 tonnes = 182,400 kg.

Tomato Sales = 182,400 kg × Rs. 7 = Rs. 1,276,800

Potatoes:
Potato Yield = 10 tonnes per acre

Total Potato Land = 16 acres

Total Potato Yield = 16 acres × 10 tonnes = 160 tonnes

Selling Price of Potato = Rs. 20 per kg

1 tonne = 1000 kg, so 160 tonnes = 160,000 kg.

Potato Sales = 160,000 kg × Rs. 20 = Rs. 3,200,000

Cabbage:
Cabbage Yield = 14 tonnes per acre

Total Cabbage Land = 16 acres

Total Cabbage Yield = 16 acres × 14 tonnes = 224 tonnes

Selling Price of Cabbage = Rs. 24 per kg

1 tonne = 1000 kg, so 224 tonnes = 224,000 kg.

Cabbage Sales = 224,000 kg × Rs. 24 = Rs. 5,376,000

Sunflower:
Sunflower Yield = 0.7 tonnes per acre

Total Sunflower Land = 16 acres

Total Sunflower Yield = 16 acres × 0.7 tonnes = 11.2 tonnes

Selling Price of Sunflower = Rs. 200 per kg

1 tonne = 1000 kg, so 11.2 tonnes = 11,200 kg.

Sunflower Sales = 11,200 kg × Rs. 200 = Rs. 2,240,000

Sugarcane:
Sugarcane Yield = 45 tonnes per acre

Total Sugarcane Land = 16 acres

Total Sugarcane Yield = 16 acres × 45 tonnes = 720 tonnes

Selling Price of Sugarcane = Rs. 4,000 per tonne

Sugarcane Sales = 720 tonnes × Rs. 4,000 = Rs. 2,880,000

Step 2: Calculate the Total Sales from All Crops
Now, let's add up the sales from all crops:

Tomato Sales: Rs. 1,276,800
Potato Sales: Rs. 3,200,000
Cabbage Sales: Rs. 5,376,000
Sunflower Sales: Rs. 2,240,000
Sugarcane Sales: Rs. 2,880,000
Total Sales = Rs. 1,276,800 + Rs. 3,200,000 + Rs. 5,376,000 + Rs. 2,240,000 + Rs. 2,880,000
Total Sales = Rs. 15,972,800

Part b: Sales Realisation from Chemical-Free Farming at the End of 11 Months
Now, let's calculate the sales realisation for the chemical-free farming.

Conversion Process:
First 6 months: Mahesh converts the vegetable segment (tomatoes, potatoes, cabbage) into chemical-free farming. He spends 6 months on this.
Next 4 months: The sunflower land is converted into chemical-free farming.
Next 4 months: The sugarcane land is converted into chemical-free farming.
So, by the end of 11 months, the vegetable segments (tomatoes, potatoes, cabbage) are fully converted to chemical-free farming, while the sunflower and sugarcane lands are not yet fully converted.

Chemical-Free Sales:
Tomatoes: The entire tomato segment (16 acres) is converted into chemical-free farming. Hence, the full yield (Rs. 1,276,800) is from chemical-free tomatoes.
Potatoes: The entire potato segment (16 acres) is converted into chemical-free farming. Hence, the full yield (Rs. 3,200,000) is from chemical-free potatoes.
Cabbage: The entire cabbage segment (16 acres) is converted into chemical-free farming. Hence, the full yield (Rs. 5,376,000) is from chemical-free cabbage.
For the sunflower and sugarcane segments, they are not fully converted to chemical-free farming by the end of 11 months. Therefore, we will assume only the chemical-free part of the land is contributing to the sales, which we will calculate.

Since sunflower and sugarcane conversion took place after 6 months (for sunflowers) and after 10 months (for sugarcane), the following crops are only partially chemical-free:

Sunflower (Conversion completed in 10 months):
Partly chemical-free sunflower land: 10/12 of the sunflower land is converted by the end of 11 months.
The yield of sunflower is Rs. 2,240,000.
Sales from partially converted sunflowers: (10/12) × Rs. 2,240,000 = Rs. 1,866,667
Sugarcane (Conversion completed in 14 months, but we need 11 months):
Partly chemical-free sugarcane land: 11/12 of the sugarcane land is converted by the end of 11 months.
The yield of sugarcane is Rs. 2,880,000.
Sales from partially converted sugarcane: (11/12) × Rs. 2,880,000 = Rs. 2,640,000
Step 3: Calculate the Total Sales from Chemical-Free Farming
Chemical-Free Tomato Sales = Rs. 1,276,800
Chemical-Free Potato Sales = Rs. 3,200,000
Chemical-Free Cabbage Sales = Rs. 5,376,000
Chemical-Free Sunflower Sales = Rs. 1,866,667
Chemical-Free Sugarcane Sales = Rs. 2,640,000
Total Chemical-Free Sales = Rs. 1,276,800 + Rs. 3,200,000 + Rs. 5,376,000 + Rs. 1,866,667 + Rs. 2,640,000
Total Chemical-Free Sales = Rs. 14,359,467

Final Answers:
a. Overall Sales Achieved by Mahesh = Rs. 15,972,800
b. Sales Realisation from Chemical-Free Farming at the End of 11 Months = Rs. 14,359,467

split the string on ':' and save the strings in the list values
for each digit/character in the number part values[1]
	digit = convert string to int 
	sum = sum + digit power 2
